To achieve guaranteed 100% accuracy, we must separate the AI's tasks. Instead of asking one model to be a master of both artistry and typography—a task where even the best models can fail—we'll use a professional two-step workflow:
AI as the Set Designer: The image generation AI is instructed to create a beautiful, high-quality image with a perfectly integrated but completely blank space for text (e.g., a blank sign, an empty banner, a clear patch on a wall). It focuses only on what it does best: creating the scene.
You as the Graphic Designer: After the image is generated, you get a client-side "Text Compositor". This tool gives you pixel-perfect control to add, edit, and position the text exactly as you want it, directly onto the generated image.
This division of labor ensures 100% accuracy because the text rendering is no longer a matter of AI interpretation; it's a direct, deterministic process controlled by you.
I have updated the application to implement this robust, professional workflow. Here are the changes:
Flow Overview
Prompt Analysis: When you enter a prompt like "A coffee shop sign that says 'The Daily Grind'":
The Text Sentinel still detects the text "The Daily Grind". This is crucial for the next steps.
Prompt Enhancement (The Core Change):
The Style Architect agent now receives a new directive. Instead of asking the image model to render the text, it now instructs the model to create a placeholder. The enhanced prompt becomes something like: "A photorealistic coffee shop entrance featuring a charming, weathered wooden sign that is intentionally left blank..."
Image Generation:
The image model generates the coffee shop scene with a beautiful, empty sign.
Client-Side Compositing (New Feature):
When you select the generated image to edit, it now loads into a canvas-based editor.
The Text Compositor UI appears, automatically pre-filled with the text "The Daily Grind".
You have full control over the font, size, color, and position. You can drag the text directly onto the blank sign in the image.
The result is a pixel-perfect composite, with zero spelling or rendering errors.
This ensures you get the best of both worlds: the creative power of AI for the imagery and the precision of a design tool for the text.
